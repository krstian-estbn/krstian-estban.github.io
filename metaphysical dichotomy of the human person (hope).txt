// humans have limitations and possibilities that allow for transcendence
// man must acknowledge, accept, and deal with his/her limitations and possibilities in order to transcend
// one must comprehend the intricacy of the human being in order to assist man in this endeavor
// the nature of the human person as an embodied spirit is complex which imposes both limitations and possibilities, therefore understanding the nature of the human being as an embodied spirit is important in order to recognize one's limitations and possibilitiese for transcendence

human nature by plato

metaphysical dichotomy
    - the nature of the human person is seen in the metaphysical dichotomy between body and soul

// dichotomy, there are 2 components of the soul, these 2 components characterized as opposites of each other

    - inherent contradiction between body and soul
        - this dichotomy implies that there is an inherent contradiction between the body and soul
        - according to plato, body is material, hence it is mutable and destructible
        - soul is immaterial, hence it is immutable and indestructible

body and soul
    - plato contends that in the context of the nature of the human person, the body's existence is dependent on the soul, while the soul's existence is independent of the body
    
    - soul existed prior to the body
        - in the timaeus, plato argues that the soul existed prior to the body
        - plato writes, the gods made the soul prior to the body and more venerable in birth and excellence to the bodies mistress and governor interestingly
    
    - human person is a soul using a body
        - eddie babor claims the contention above made plato conclude that the human person is just a soul using a body

tripartite soul
    - rational soul
        - is located in the head
        - it's function is to guide the spiritual and appetitive soul
        - think
            - enables the human person to think, refelect, analyze, comprehend, draw conclusions, and the like
        - highest of all parts of the soul
    - spiritual soul
        - is located in the chest
        - contribute to the motion and activity of the whole person (both the spiritual and appetitive soul)
        - emotional feelings
            - drives the human person to experience abomination, anger, and other emotional feelings
    - appetitive soul
        - is located in the abdomen
        - contribute to the motion and activity of the whole person (both the spiritual and appetitive soul)
        - physical wants
            - drives the human person to experience thirst, hunger, and other physical wants

    // thirsty man in the desert, he sees a pool of water and approaches it with all the eagerness that deprivation can create, but when he reaches the pool he sees a sign, danger do no drink, polluted, he experiences conflict (spritual soul) within his desire that urges him to drink (appetitive soul) but the reason tells him that such sign usually indicate tha truth, that polluted water will make him very ill or may kill him and that if he will probably be worse off than he doesnt, he decides not to drink (rational soul)
    // in this case it is the rational part of the soul that opposes his desire, his reason guides him away from the water
    // the principle then that drives the person to drink is called appetite
    // the principle that forbids the person to drink the water because it is polluted is called reason

on the components of the soul
    - plato illustrates the limitations and possibilities of the human person on the following context
        - the human person has body and soul
        - the components of the human soul on the body and soul of man
        - the nature of the human body and soul imposes limitations and possibilities
    
    - soul exists prior to the body
        - for plato the soul exists prior to the body, it can then be concluded that
        - the soul is an entity distinct from the body
        - the body and soul are separable
        - the human person is just a soul using a body

    - soul
        - possibilities: eternal
            - plato believes that the soul is imprisoned in the body
            - the soul survives the death of the body because the soul is immaterial, immutable, and indestructible
        - world of forms
            - when the person dies the soul leaves the body and goes back to the world of forms
            - soul from the world of form creates human possibilities because it is immaterial, immutable, indestructible, and eternal
    - body
        - limitations: decomposes
            - the body decomposes because it is material, mutable, and destructible
        - world of matter
            - body in th world of matter sets limits to the human person because it is material, mutable, destructible, and temporal

    - plato's doctrine of form
        - world of forms
            - where everything comes from
        - world of matter
            -  everything that exists

components of the human soul

what makes up the soul?
    - desire: motivates
    - spirit: animates
    - reason: guides

    - appetite and spiritual soul set limitations to the human person (spirit and desire)
    - they possess a positive and negative nature

    - rational soul, positioned in the highest level, is therefore the possibilities of the human person
    - it works on reason

    // a man who is angry with another person who insulted him desires to kill his offender, but does not actually kill the culprit because he knows that if he does he will be in prison
    // the desire of man limits himself/herself but the reasoning of man serves the possibility to redirect man
    // plato argues that it is the spirit in man that makes the person angry with his derirder, yet his anger is curbed  by reason, that is by the rational soul

transcendence
    - overcoming ones limitations through the gift of possibilities
    - in its simplest sense is the capacity of the individual to overcome his limitations
    - the human person is endowed with possibilities that he/she can utilize to transcend

    - trancendental can be achieved by
        - harnessing the blessings of the human soul
        - maintaining a well-balanced personality
            - it is achieved by allowing reason to successfully guide desire and spirit
    
    - plato's metaphysical dichotomy of the human person
        - it suggests that the human being is not just a physical body, but an embodied spirit
        - the nature of man is an embodied spirit, sets the limitations and possibilities for human transcendence
        - by recognizing the limitations of the body and the possibilities of the soul, man cann be able to transcend

summary
    - plato's dichotomy of the human person suggests that man is an embodied spirit in which man is body and soul
    - man's embodiment causes limitations and possibilities for human transcendence. in which the body sets the limits because it is mutable and destructible, but the soul creates possibilities because it is immutable and indestructible
    - the three parts of the Soul illustrates that the appetitive of soul and the spiritual soul impose limits while the rational soul creates possibilities because it guides the appetitive and the spiritual. with this transcendence of man is possible through the rational soul
