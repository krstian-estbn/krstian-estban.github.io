review: mitosis (i dont know anything about this shit)

mitosis
    - in order to make new body cells, the cell cycle must occur
    - during this, one cell divides to form 2 daughter cells with exactly the same dna
    - the cell cycle includes
        - interphase
        - mitosis
        - cytokinesis

interphase
    - happens before mitosis
    - the cell does normal cell activities
        - making proteins
    - chromatin
        - two stringy pieces of dna in the nucleus
        - uncoiled stringy dna
        - 2 pieces of chromatin = 2 dna molecules
        - each cell has 46 pieces of chromatin
    - before mitosis, the dna must replicate itself

mitosis
    - after interphase
    - an important part of cell division, which allows you to make more cells
    - making more cells is needed for
        - growth
        - development
        - tissue repair/healing
    - you must do mitosis if you want to...
        - grow larger than a single-celled zygote
        - make more skin cells or any type of blood cell
    - ultimately results in the formation of 2 genetically identical daughter cells
    - has 4 phases
        - prophase
        - metaphase
        - anaphase
        - telophase

prophase
    - is that the chromosomes condense and become visible
    - condensation: chromosomes become condense
    - the chromatin gets packaged up so that it is easier to move around
    - each chromosome has 2 halves
    - each half of a chromsome is called a sister chromatid
    - sister chromatids of a chromosome are identical
    - we must move the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell in order to divide up the dna
    - the nucleus disintegrates during the prophase
    
metaphase
    - the chromosomes line up single file down the middle of the cell

anaphase
    - sister chromatids split up and move towards opposite poles

telophase
    - 2 diploid daughter cells are being formed
    - each newly froming cell makes a nucleus
    - the chromosomes uncoil to make chromatin again

cytokinesis
    - occurs at the same time with the telophase
    - the cell divides completely
    - makes 2 diploid cells that are genetically identical

somatic cells
    - body cells
    - diploid (2n)
    - 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46
    - e.g. muscle cells, neurons, liver cells, skin cells, bone cells, etc.

gametes
    - sex cells
    - haploid (n)
    - single set of chromosomes for a total of 23 chromosomes
    - egg and sperm cells

meiosis
    - human life cycle
    - multicellular diploid adults
        - mother and father reconstitute the original number of chromosomes: 46
    - gametes
        - haploid in nature
        - when egg cell and sperm cell unite through fertilization it will yield a diploid zygote containing 46 chromosomes
    - during the start of meiosis, it reconstitute the original number of chromosomes: 46

meiosis
    - is the process that results in the formation of sperm cells and egg cells
    - the cells that will undergo meiosis are typically found in the testes and ovaries of males and females
    - these germline cells are diploid (2n)
        - having two sets of chromosomes
    - but will undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells (n)
        - having one set of chromosomes
    - during fertilization, these haploid cells fuse to form a diploid offspring
    - is preceded by an interphase
    - involves two divisions

interphase
    - dna replicates and each chromosome becomes doubled consisting of two identical strands of dna

meiosis 1
    - first division
    - halves the number of chromosomes
    - begins with prophase 1

prophase 1
    - individual replicated chromosomes become visible
    - each chromosome consists of identical sister chromatids, joined at their centromeres
    - the spindle fibers start to form
    - nuclear envelope disintegrates
    - homologous chromosomes line up next to each other
    - an event unique to meiosis occurs called crossing-over

crossing-over
    - two homologous chromosomes which are lined up next to each other, exchange dna between adjacent homologous chromatids
    - sister chromatids of one chromosome are no longer identical to one another

metaphase 1
    - homologous chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell
    - for each pair of homologs, the orientation on the equator is random
    - each different orientation results in gametes with different combinations of parental chromosomes
    - this process is called independent assortment
    - the ends of the spindle fibers attach to each centromere once the chromosomes are lined up

anaphase 1
    - the chromosomes move apart from one another along the spindle fiber to the opposite ends of the cell
    - each chromosome is still double stranded and has two sister chromatids
    - we are separating homologous chromosomes into two different cells
    - each new cell will have only one member of the homologous pair and will be haploid

telophase 1
    - the spindle fiber disintegrates
    - cytokinesis/cell division begins

// thus in meiosis 1, from prophase 1 - telophase 1, two cells are created and each cell has half the number of chromosomes compared to the original cell

meiosis 2
    - second division
    - the sister chromatids are split
    - the end result is four haploid cells
    - after cytokinesis is complete, this second division starts
    - identical to mitosis
    - the resulting cells have the exact same number of chromosomes as teh original cell at the end of meiosis 1

prophase 2
    - we now have two cells each with two chromosomes
    - the spindle fibers, again start to form at the poles of the cell

metaphase 2
    - the chromosomes line up along the equator
    - different from metaphase 1, where the homologous chromosomes were lined up
    - each cell has only one of each homologous chromosome

anaphase 2
    - the sister chromatids move away from each other along the spindle fiber

telophase 2
    - along with cytokinesis
    - the formation of four genetically different halpoid cells






POWERPOINT

meiosis
    - is the process by which gametes are generated for reproduction
    - germline cells: gametes or sex cells
    - is the process that produces haploid gametes in diploid organisms
    - in meiosis, a cell undergoes two consecutive divisions, meiosis 1 and meiosis 2

first meiotic division
    - also known as reduction/reductional division
second meiotic division
    - equational division

- four haploid daughter cells result from these divisions
- in contrast to the two diploid daughter cells that result from mitotic cell division
- as a result, each of the four daughter cells resulting from meiosis has only half as many chromosomes as teh starting cell- a single haploid set of chromosomes

meiosis
    - reduces the amount of genetic information
    - produces haploid gametes or spores with only one set of chromosomes
    - during sexual reproduction, gametes combine in the fertilization to reconstitute the diploid complement found in parental cells

interphase
    - at the end of this interphase, each chromosome consists of two genetically identical sister chromatids, attaached together
    - the chromosomes are not yet visible under the microscope except as a dense mass of chromatin fiber
    - the cell's centrosome has also dupllicated by the end of this interphase
    - centrosome houses the centrioles where in the spindel fiber arises

centrosome
    - centromere: center region of a chromosome
    - houses the centrioles
    - there are a pair of centrioles inside each centrosome
    - from there emerges the spindel fibers during mitosis
    - spindel fibers/spindel microtubules
    - centrioles are unique to animal cells

meiosis 1
prophase 1
    - is the most complex phase of meiosis
    - typically occupies 90% of the time required for meiotic cell division
    - early in this phase, the chromatin coils up
    - in a process called synapsis, homologous chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, come together as pairs
    - the resulting structure, consisting of four chromatids, is called a tetrad/bivalent tetrad
    - during synapsis, chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange segments in a process called crossing over
    - 5 substages of prophase 1
        - leptatene/leptonema
        - zygotene/zygonema
        - pachytene/pachynema
        - diplotene/diplonema
        - diakinesis
    - the chromosomes condense further as the nucleoli disappear
    - the centrosomes move away from each other and a spindle starts to form between them
    - the nuclear envelope breaks into fragments
    - chromsome tetrads, captured by spindel microtubules, are moved toward the center

synapsis
    - pairing of homologous chromosomes/homologs
    - an important event before crossing-over
    - maternal homologue/homolog
    - paternal homologue/homolog
    - synaptonemal complex: a protein which mediates synapsis
    - how will maternal and paternal pair
    - zygotene/zygonema

parts of a dyad
    - short arm: p-arm
    - long arm: q-arm
    - center region: centromere (dna)
    - protein: kinetochore
    - sister chromatids
    - non-sister chromatids

crossing-over
    - a physical exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids
    - chiasma/chiasmata: sites of crossing-over
    - pachytene/pachynema
    - homologous chromosomes
        - non-sister chromatids
        - sister chromatids
    - bivalent tetrad
        - chiasma: single site
    - recombinant chromatids
    - most important of meiosis
    - due to crossing-over, there is genetic recombination/diversity, different traits between siblings

substages of prophase 1
leptotene
    - prophase begins
    - chromosomes start to condense
    - replicated chromosomes have coiled and already visible
    - the number of chromosomes present is the same as the number in diploid cell
zygotene
    - synapsis begins
    - synaptonemal complex forms
    - homologue chromosomes begin to pair and twist around each other in a highly specific manner
    - the pairing is called synapsis
    - because the pair consists of four chromatids it is referred to as bivalent tetrad
pachytene
    - crossing over
    - dna exchanged by non-sister chromatids
    - chromosomes become much shorter and thicker
    - a form of physical exchange between homologues takes place at specific regions
    - the process of physical exchange of a chromosome region is called crossing-over
    - through the mechanism of crossing over, the parts of the homologous chromosomes are recombined, genetic recombination
diplotene
    - synapsis ends
    - chiasma visible within bivalent
    - the two pairs of sister chromatids begin to separate from each other
    - the area of contact between non-sister chromatids, called chiasma, become evident
diakinesis
    - prophase ends
    - nuclear membrane disintegrates
    - terminalization chiasma/chiasmatin
        - chiasma tends to move towards the end of the chromosomes
        - main reason is to hold the homologues chromosomes, because they will separate during anaphase
    - the four chromatids of each tetrad are even more condensed and the chiasma often terminalize or move down the chromatids to the ends
    - this delays the separation of homologous chromosomes

metaphase 1
    - the chromosome tetrads are aligned on the metaphase plate, midway between the two poles of the spindle
    - each chromosome is condensed and thick with its sister chromatids still attached at their centromeres
    - spindle microtubules are attached to kinetochores at the centromeres
    - in each tetrad, the homologous chromosomes are held together at sites of crossing over
    - for each tetrad, the spindle microtubules attached to one of the homologous chromosomes come from one pole of the cell, and the microtubules attached to the other homologous chromosomes come from opposite pole
    - with this arrangement, the homologous chromosomes of each tetrad are poised to move toward opposite poles of the cell

anaphase 1
    - is marked by the migration of chromosomes toward the two poles of the cell
    - in contrast to mitosis, the sister chromatids making up each double chromosome remain attached at the centromeres
    - only the tetrards, pair of homologous chromosomes, split up

telophase 1 and cytokinesis
    - the chromosomes arrive at the poles of the cell
    - each pole of the cell has a haploid chromosome set, although each chromosome is still in duplicate from at this point
    - in other words, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids
    - usually cytokinesis occurs along with telophase 1 and two haploid daughter cells are formed
    - in some organisms, the chromosomes uncoil and the nuclear envelope reforms and there is an interphase before meiosis 2 begins
    - in other species, daughter cells produced in the first meiotic division immediately begin preparation for the secod meiotic division
    - in either case, no chromosome duplication occurs between telophase 1 and the onset of meiosis 2

first meiotic division
    - reduction/reductional division
    - from diploid, it reconstitutes the original number of chromosomes
    - 2n >> n

second meiotic division
    - equational division
    - it preserves the halves number of chromosomes
    - n >> n
    - is the same to mitosis, difference lies in the number of chromosomes
    - second meiotic division: n, mitosis: 2n >> nn

meiosis 2
    - is essentially the same as mitosis
    - the important difference is that it starts with a haploid cell

prophase 2
    - in organisms having an interphase after meiosis 1
    - the chromosomes condesne again
    - the nuclear envelope breaks down
    - a spindle forms and move toward the middle of the cell

metaphase 2
    - the chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate with the kinetochores of the sister chromatids of each chromosome pointing toward opposite poles

anaphase 2
    - the centromeres of sister chromatids finally separate
    - the sister chromatids of each pair, now individual daughter chromosomes, move toward opposite poles of the cell

telophase 2 and cytokinesis
    - nuclei form at the cell poles
    - cytokinesis occurs
    - there are now 4 daughter cells, each with the haploid number of (single) chromosomes

prophase 2
    - the dyads contract
metaphase 2
    - the centromeres are directed to th equatorial plate and then divide
anaphase 2
    - the sister chromatids (monads) move away from each other and migrate to the opposite poles of the spindle fiber
telophase 2
    - the monads are at the poles, forming 2 groups of chromosomes
    - a nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes

cytokinesis
    - the 2 nuclei are compartmentalized
    into separate daughter cells and complete the mitotic cell division process
    - in animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by the formation of the constriction in the middle of the cell until two daughter cells are formed, the constriction is often called cleavage, or cell furrow
    - in most, plant cells, this constriction is not evident, instead a new cell membrane and cell are assembled between the 2 nuclei to form a cell plate
    - each side of the cell plate is coated with a cell wall that eventually forms the two progeny cells

memory word game
    - meiosis
    - pachytene/pachynema
    - zygotene/zygonema
    - synapsis
    - crossing-over
    - equational division
    - reductional division
    - second meiotic division

significance of meiosis and chromosome number
    - chromosomes are the cell's way of neatly arranging long strands of dna
    - non-sex cells have two sets of chromosomes, one set from each parental
    - meiosis makes sex cells with only one set of chromosomes
    - for example, human cells have 46 chromosome, with the exception of sperm and egg, which contain only 23 chromosomes each
    - when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg, the 23 chromosomes from each sex cell combine to make a zygote, a new cell with 46 chromosomes
    - the zygote is the first cell in a new individual

significance of meiosis for diversity
    - one of the benefits of sexual reproduction is the diversity it produces within a population
    - that variety is a direct product of meiosis
    - every sex cell made from meiosis has a unique combination of chromosomes
    - this means that no two sperm or egg cells are genetically identical
    - every fertilization event produces new combinations of traits
    - this is why siblings share dna with parents and each other, but are not identical to one another

arise from errors in meiosis, usually meiosis 1
    - occur more often during egg formation (90% of the time) than during sperm formation
    - become more frequent as a woman ages
    - aneuploidy
        - is the gain or loss of whole chromosomes
        - it is the most common chromosome abnormality
        - it is caused by non-disjunction, the failure of chromosomes to correctly separate
            - homologues during meiosis 1 or
            - sister chromatids during meiosis 2

differentiate meiosis and mitosis
meiosis
    - requires 2 nuclear division
    - chromosomes synapse and cross-over
    - centromeres survive anaphas 1
    - halves chromosomes number
    - produces 4 daughter nuclei
    - produces daughter cells genetically diffeent from parent and each other
    - used only for sexual reproduction

mitosis
    - requires one nuclear division
    - chromsomes do not synapse nor cross-over
    - centromeres dissolve in mitotic phase
    - preserves chromosome number
    - produces 2 daughter nuclei
    - produces daughter cells genetically identical to parent and to each other
    - used for asexual reproduction and growth
