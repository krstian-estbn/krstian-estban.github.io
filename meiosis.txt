review: mitosis (i dont know anything about this shit)

mitosis
    - in order to make new body cells, the cell cycle must occur
    - during this, one cell divides to form 2 daughter cells with exactly the same dna
    - the cell cycle includes
        - interphase
        - mitosis
        - cytokinesis

interphase
    - happens before mitosis
    - the cell does normal cell activities
        - making proteins
    - chromatin
        - two stringy pieces of dna in the nucleus
        - uncoiled stringy dna
        - 2 pieces of chromatin = 2 dna molecules
        - each cell has 46 pieces of chromatin
    - before mitosis, the dna must replicate itself

mitosis
    - after interphase
    - an important part of cell division, which allows you to make more cells
    - making more cells is needed for
        - growth
        - development
        - tissue repair/healing
    - you must do mitosis if you want to...
        - grow larger than a single-celled zygote
        - make more skin cells or any type of blood cell
    - ultimately results in the formation of 2 genetically identical daughter cells
    - has 4 phases
        - prophase
        - metaphase
        - anaphase
        - telophase

prophase
    - is that the chromosomes condense and become visible
    - condensation: chromosomes become condense
    - the chromatin gets packaged up so that it is easier to move around
    - each chromosome has 2 halves
    - each half of a chromsome is called a sister chromatid
    - sister chromatids of a chromosome are identical
    - we must move the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell in order to divide up the dna
    - the nucleus disintegrates during the prophase
    
metaphase
    - the chromosomes line up single file down the middle of the cell

anaphase
    - sister chromatids split up and move towards opposite poles

telophase
    - 2 diploid daughter cells are being formed
    - each newly froming cell makes a nucleus
    - the chromosomes uncoil to make chromatin again

cytokinesis
    - occurs at the same time with the telophase
    - the cell divides completely
    - makes 2 diploid cells that are genetically identical

somatic cells
    - body cells
    - diploid (2n)
    - 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46
    - e.g. muscle cells, neurons, liver cells, skin cells, bone cells, etc.

gametes
    - sex cells
    - haploid (n)
    - single set of chromosomes for a total of 23 chromosomes
    - egg and sperm cells

meiosis
    - human life cycle
    - multicellular diploid adults
        - mother and father reconstitute the original number of chromosomes: 46
    - gametes
        - haploid in nature
        - when egg cell and sperm cell unite through fertilization it will yield a diplod zygote containing 46 chromosomes
    - during the start of meiosis, it reconstitute the original number of chromosomes: 46

meiosis
    - is the process that results in the formation of sperm cells and egg cells
    - the cells that will undergo meiosis are typically found in the testes and ovaries of males and females
    - these germline cells are diploid (2n)
        - having two sets of chromosomes
    - but will undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells (n)
        - having one set of chromosomes
    - during fertilization, these haploid cells fuse to form a diploid offspring
    - is preceded by an interphase
    - involves two divisions

interphase
    - dna replicates and each chromosome becomes doubled consisting of two identical strands of dna

meiosis 1
    - first division
    - halves the number of chromosomes
    - begins with prophase 1

prophase 1
    - individual replicated chromosomes become visible
    - each chromosome consists of identical sister chromatids, joined at their centromeres
    - the spindle fibers start to form
    - nuclear envelope disintegrates
    - homologous chromosomes line up next to each other
    - an event unique to meiosis occurs called crossing-over

crossing-over
    - two homologous chromosomes which are lined up next to each other, exchange dna between adjacent homologous chromatids
    - sister chromatids of one chromosome are no longer identical to one another

metaphase 1
    - homologous chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell
    - for each pair of homologs, the orientation on the equator is random
    - each different orientation results in gametes with different combinations of parental chromosomes
    - this process is called independent assortment
    - the ends of the spindle fibers attach to each centromere once the chromosomes are lined up

anaphase 1
    - the chromosomes move apart from one another along the spindle fiber to the opposite ends of the cell
    - each chromosome is still double stranded and has two sister chromatids
    - we are separating homologous chromosomes into two different cells
    - each new cell will have only one member of the homologous pair and will be haploid

telophase 1
    - the spindle fiber disintegrates
    - cytokinesis/cell division begins

// thus in meiosis 1, from prophase 1 - telophase 1, two cells are created and each cell has half the number of chromosomes compared to the original cell

meiosis 2
    - second division
    - the sister chromatids are split
    - the end result is four haploid cells
    - after cytokinesis is complete, this second division starts
    - identical to mitosis
    - the resulting cells have the exact same number of chromosomes as teh original cell at the end of meiosis 1

prophase 2
    - we now have two cells each with two chromosomes
    - the spindle fibers, again start to form at the poles of the cell

metaphase 2
    - the chromosomes line up along the equator
    - different from metaphase 1, where the homologous chromosomes were lined up
    - each cell has only one of each homologous chromosome

anaphase 2
    - the sister chromatids move away from each other along the spindle fiber

telophase 2
    - along with cytokinesis
    - the formation of four genetically different halpoid cells






POWERPOINT

meiosis
    - is the process by which gametes are generated for reproduction
    - germline cells: gametes or sex cells
    - is the process that produces haploid gametes in diploid organisms
    - in meiosis, a cell undergoes two consecutive divisions, meiosis 1 and meiosis 2

first meiotic division
    - also known as reduction/reductional division
second meiotic division
    - equational division

- four haploid daughter cells result from these divisions
- in contrast to the two diploid daughter cells that result from mitotic cell division
- as a result, each of the four daughter cells resulting from meiosis has only half as many chromosomes as teh starting cell- a single haploid set of chromosomes

meiosis
    - reduces the amount of genetic information
    - produces haploid gametes or spores with only one set of chromosomes
    - during sexual reproduction, gametes combine in the fertilization to reconstitute the diploid complement found in parental cells

interphase
    - at the end of this interphase, each chromosome consists of two genetically identical sister chromatids, attaached together
    - the chromosomes are not yet visible under the microscope except as a dense mass of chromatin fiber
    - the cell's centrosome has also dupllicated by the end of this interphase
    - centrosome houses the centrioles where in the spindel fiber arises

centrosome
    - centromere: center region of a chromosome
    - houses the centrioles
    - there are a pair of centrioles inside each centrosome
    - from there emerges the spindel fibers during mitosis
    - spindel fibers/spindel microtubules
    - centrioles are unique to animal cells

meiosis 1
prophase 1
    - is the most complex phase of meiosis
    - typically occupies 90% of the time required for meiotic cell division
    - early in this phase, the chromatin coils up
    - in a process called synapsis, homologous chromosomes, each composed of two sister chromatids, come together as pairs
    - the resulting structure, consisting of four chromatids, is called a tetrad/bivalent tetrad
    - during synapsis, chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange segments in a process called crossing over
    - 5 substages of prophase 1
        - leptatene/leptonema
        - zygotene/zygonema
        - pachytene/pachynema
        - diplotene/diplonema
        - diakinesis
    - the chromosomes condense further as the nucleoli disappear
    - the centrosomes move away from each other and a spindle starts to form between them
    - the nuclear envelope breaks into fragments
    - chromsome tetrads, captured by spindel microtubules, are moved toward the center

synapsis
    - pairing of homologous chromosomes/homologs
    - an important event before crossing-over
    - maternal homologue/homolog
    - paternal homologue/homolog
    - synaptonemal complex: a protein which mediates synapsis
    - how will maternal and paternal pair
    - zygotene/zygonema

parts of a dyad
    - short arm: p-arm
    - long arm: q-arm
    - center region: centromere (dna)
    - protein: kinetochore
    - sister chromatids
    - non-sister chromatids

crossing-over
    - a physical exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids
    - chiasma/chiasmata: sites of crossing-over
    - pachytene/pachynema
    - homologous chromosomes
        - non-sister chromatids
        - sister chromatids
    - bivalent tetrad
        - chiasma: single site
    - recombinant chromatids
    - most important of meiosis
    - due to crossing-over, there is genetic recombination/diversity, different traits between siblings
